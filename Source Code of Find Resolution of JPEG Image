Python Program to Find the Size (Resolution) of a Image
Python Program to Find the Size (Resolution) of a Image
You will learn to find resolution of a jpeg image in this example without using external libraries

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics:

Python Functions
Python User-defined Functions
Python File I/O
JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group. It is one of the most widely used compression techniques for image compression.

Most of the file formats have headers (initial few bytes) which contain useful information about the file.

For example, jpeg headers contain information like height, width, number of color (grayscale or RGB) etc. In this program, we find the resolution of a jpeg image reading these headers, without using any external library.

Source Code of Find Resolution of JPEG Image
def jpeg_res(filename):
   """"This function prints the resolution of the jpeg image file passed into it"""

   # open image for reading in binary mode
   with open(filename,'rb') as img_file:

       # height of image (in 2 bytes) is at 164th position
       img_file.seek(163)

       # read the 2 bytes
       a = img_file.read(2)

       # calculate height
       height = (a[0] << 8) + a[1]

       # next 2 bytes is width
       a = img_file.read(2)

       # calculate width
       width = (a[0] << 8) + a[1]

   print("The resolution of the image is",width,"x",height)

jpeg_res("img1.jpg")
